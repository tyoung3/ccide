TODO: 
	. 0.6.0-2
		. Fix Java
	. Release 0.5.0-8
		. Name from Ccide to Ccidew in error messages. w/version.
		. Document/improve release workflow.
			. ZIP file for Windows.  -- 'make dist-zip'
				. Ensure unix2dos run on all text files.
	. Fix configure.in to verify functions like strncpy and sprintf.
	. Publicize.
		. README.md for GitHub
	. Create ccide[.BAT] file for Windows.
		. Test Windows/mingw/cygwin.
	. Include test cases in RPM Source.
	. Additional program checks.  Increase testing coverage.
		. Check threeway expansion, compilation, and execution.
		. If the corresponding compiler is present
			. Check C++ thru execution.
			. Check Java thru execution.
		   otherwise issue a compiler missing warning.
        . Change ccide script to accept multiple file names and if the -L language option is ommitted,
		    convert according to suffixes: (using an intermediate file if the output file name 
		    would duplicate the input filename).
		. Ex.  'ccide foobar.LANG.d' will execute ccide -L LANG < foobar.LANG.d > foobar.LANG
			where LANG=cpp, qb, java, etc.
	. Fix web site demo
		. Update on-line man page 
	. Make valgrind clean
