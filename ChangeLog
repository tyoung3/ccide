	* Numerous fixes to BASH script generation.

	  /* .... */.     
	* Fixed standard C comment recognition and generation. 
	* Added environment variable, CCIDEW, to ccide script, to
	  facillitate testing.  If CCIDEW is empty, the ccide script will
	  attempt to find the ccidew program and set the CCIDEW variable 
	  equal to its location; otherwise, the script will attempt to use
	  the program at the CCIDEW location.
	* Changed C program output from C++ style comments(//) to C style
	  comments(/*...*/) to enhance portability.
	* Added logic to suppress unnecessary condition evaluation (e.g.

	  code generator. 

2004-09-06
	* Allowed for multiple $$ substitutions in one action or condition stub.
	* Implemented -m4 option and m4 macros to create language independent
	  output and conversion to C, C++, or BASH.

2004-08-28
	* Added optional size parameter to the -s(skeleton) option, for
	  generating skeleton programs of a specified size.
	* Increased the maximum number of actions from 32 to 1024.
	* Increased the maximum number of rules from 32 to 256.
	* Added optimization such that fewer actions are generated when
	  trailing actions are equal for non-adjacent rules.
	* Added [-c COLWIDTH] option to specify the number of characters
	  in each action or condition entry.
	* Increased the maximum size of an integer entry from 99
	  to 99999.
	* Added [-L LANG] option.  LANG = C|CC|BASH.  LANG defaults to C. 
	
2004-08-26 
	*ccideparse.y: Added [-a] option to allow duplicate actions. 
	*ccidemain.c: Changed to generate conditional code for
	              the single rule special case.     
	*ccidemain.c: Changed design assumption such that ccide assumes
		      that actions always involve side effects and that
		      conditions never involve side effects.  Later,
		      a '[CONDITIONS WITH] SIDE EFFECTS' option
		      will be available in the '//DECISION_TABLE:' statement.
		      This change does not require changes to existing
	              programs.

	*ccidemain.c:  Added code to check for a lonely '=' in a 
	               condition expression (a common C error).  Also
		       added -e option to bypass this check. 
	*ccidemain.h:  In ERROR3 function, added 'RC=1' so ccide return
	               code is 1 if any ERROR3 occurs.

2004-08-17 Tom Young <ccide@twyoung.com>
	* New 'State Machine' functionality
	  In the special case where a single condition row containing
	  integers is specified and the condition stub is in the form of:

        	... | EXPRESSION == $$

	  ccide will generate 'state machine' code, replacing the
	  CcideFindRule.. function with a switch(EXPRESSION) statement, and 
	  using the row integers in a case statement.

	* Updated copyright messages.
	* Added [-s] option to produce a skeleton(example) program.
	* Added [-u](undo) option to strip out generated code without
	  generating new code.
