Ccide generate compilable code in a number of languages(including JAVA, C/C++, BASH script, and Euphoria; from a source language file containing one or more commented decision tables.  Decision tables are easier to read than traditional if-then-else structures, thereby helping to prevent logic errors.

Install Note:
	Normal procedure is ./configure, make, make check, install. 
	To rebuild from scratch, run the './autogen.sh' script in the installation
	directory(contains Makefile.am, etc.) and run 'make'. Run 'make check'
	to verify the build.  On Windows systems, you might want to do something like
	'make DESTDIR=/mingw' to install.
	Running 'make install', as root, will install ccide without package management.
	Or, you can build an rpm by running 'make rpm', as root, then install the rpm.
	The ccide source code itself contains several, previously expanded, decision tables.
