Ccide generates C code from a file containing C code and one or more 
decision tables.  Using the m4 preprocessor, Ccide can generate code in a number
of other languages(including JAVA, C++, BASH script, and Euphoria from language 
files which contain commented decision tables.

Embedded decision tables make programs with if-then-else logic easier to read, 
thereby helping to prevent logic errors.

Install Note:
	To rebuild from scratch, run the './autogen.sh' script in the installation
	directory(contains Makefile.am, etc.) and run 'make'. Run 'make check'
	to verify your build. 
	Running 'make install', as root, will install ccide without package management.
	Or, you can build an rpm by running 'make rpm', as root, then installing the rpm.
	The ccide source code itself contains several, previously expanded, decision tables.
