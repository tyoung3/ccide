Ccide generates compilable code in a number of languages(including JAVA, C/C++, BASH script, and Euphoria; from a source language file containing one or more commented decision tables.  Decision tables are easier to read than traditional if-then-else structures, thereby helping to prevent logic errors.

Install Note:
	Normal procedure is configure, make check, install. 
	Use ./configure --disable-nls  if the libintl is not available.
	To rebuild from scratch, run the './autogen.sh' script in the installation
	directory(contains Makefile.am, etc.) and run 'make'.  You may need a working
	version of ccide to regenerate ccide ccideparse.y and ccidemain.c as
	the ccide source code itself contains several, previously expanded, decision tables. 

	Running 'make install' will install ccide without package management.	
	On Windows systems, you will want to do something like
	'make DESTDIR=/mingw install' to install.

	You can build an rpm by running 'make rpm' then install the rpm, as root.
