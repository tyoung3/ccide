Ccide generates C code from a file containing C code and one or more 
decision tables.  Using the m4 preprocessor, Ccide can generate code in a number
of other languages from language files which contain commented decision tables.
Embedded decision tables make programs easier to read, thereby helping to
prevent logic errors.
 
See the man page for a complete description or visit 
http://ccide.sourceforge.com/ for more information.

Install Note:
	To rebuild from scratch, run the 'build' script in the installation
	directory(contains Makefile.am, etc.) and run 'make'. Run 'make check'
	to verify your build. 
	Running 'make install', as root, will install ccide without package management.
	Or, you can build an rpm by running 'make rpm', as root, then installing the rpm.
